Its predecessor, no longer in use but still standing, was constructed in 1883, making it one of the oldest buildings in all the Westman Islands. All construction materials had to be hauled up steep cliff faces and carried overland, making the construction of the 200 sq.m. lodge quite an undertaking. The lodge is owned by its 35 members.' }</p>
