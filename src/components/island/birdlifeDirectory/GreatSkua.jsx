Great skuas show little fear of humans. During breeding seasons, they fiercely defend their nest from any and all intruders, including humans. Although the great skua cannot inflict serious damage, this can make for a less than pleasant experience. We can still relax in Elli√∞aey, since their nesting area is not on the island but on the coast of Iceland.' }</p>
