After the female lays a single egg, both parents take turns incubating the egg for about 40 days. Puffins spend the autumn and winter out at sea and return to land to breed in late spring. They usually mate for life and return to the same burrow year after year, marking their return with a thorough spring cleaning. Puffins are known to have reached over 30 years of age.' } </p>
